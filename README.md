**Memory4Lang** is a fun, interactive drag-and-drop memory game for learning French translations. It's designed to help users practice their vocabulary by matching English and French words, all within a playful interface inspired by the classic "Memory" game.

You can access a deployed version of the game [here](https://main.d21ai12uuembj2.amplifyapp.com/)


## üéÆ How the Game Works 

- You are presented with two columns:
    - A **bank** of draggable words
    - A **target column** of fixed rows, each representing a word in the target language
- Your task is to **drag each word from the bank** and drop it on the row representing its correct translation.
- You can move words back to the bank and rearrange them freely
- Once you're done, click **GRADE** to evaluate your performance


## ‚ú® Scoring System
- **80% and above**: Exceptional üéâ Confetti and sound effects celebrate your mastery.
- **50% to 79%**: Solid pass ‚úÖ ‚Äî a job well done.
- **Below 50%**: Encouragement to try again ‚òπÔ∏è.

The game is fully **mobile-friendly**, supports **touch-based drag-and-drop**, and adjusts its layout for smaller screens.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Settings
Accessible via the top-right **menu button (‚ò∞),** the Settings Modal allows you to:
- **Reverse the direction**: Switch from English -> French or French -> English
- **Mute sounds**: Toggle sound effects
- **Personalize**: Enter your name for custome score message when graded

Settings are saved to `sessionStorage` and persist during your session.
